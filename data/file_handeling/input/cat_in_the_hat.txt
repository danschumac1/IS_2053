“I know some good games we could play,” 
Said the cat. 
“I know some new tricks,” 
Said the Cat in the Hat. 
“A lot of good tricks. 
I will show them to you. 
Your mother 
Will not mind at all if I do.” 
Then Sally and I 
Did not know what to say.  
Our mother was out of the house 
For the day. 
But our fish said, “No! No! 
Make that cat go away! 
Tell that Cat in the Hat 
 You do NOT want to play. 
He should not be here. 
He should not be about. 
He should not be here 
When your mother is out!” 
“Now! Now! Have no fear. 
Have no fear!” said the cat. 
“My tricks are not bad,” 
Said the Cat in the Hat. 
“Why, we can have 
Lots of good fun, if you wish, 
With a game that I call 
 UP-UP-UP with a fish!” 
“Put me down!” said the fish. 
“This is no fun at all! 
Put me don!” said the fish. 
“I do NOT wish to fall!” 
“Have no fear!” said the cat. 
“I will not let you fall. 
I will hold you up high 
As I stand on a ball. 
With a book on one hand! 
And a cup on my hat! 
But that is not ALL I can do!’ 
Said the cat
